# HardwareID-Spoofer
My old HWID-Spoofer hardware source. The spoofer spoofs your HWID to NULL, which you can simply modify if you don't like it!




This source was a very old project of mine from 2019, but it still works and is a nice starting point if you want to build your own spoofer. I'm not going to update this source anymore; I simply thought I'd share it!
